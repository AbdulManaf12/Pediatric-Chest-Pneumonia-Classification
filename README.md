## Abstract

This project presents an innovative approach to pediatric chest pneumonia classification using deep learning techniques. We address the critical challenge of class imbalance in medical imaging datasets by employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation, combined with traditional data augmentation methods. Our methodology demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy and model robustness for pneumonia detection in pediatric chest X-rays.

## Introduction

Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years globally. Early and accurate diagnosis through chest X-ray analysis is crucial for effective treatment. However, medical imaging datasets often suffer from class imbalance, where normal cases significantly outnumber pneumonia cases. This project addresses this challenge by:

1. **Data Balancing**: Using GANs to generate synthetic normal chest X-ray images
2. **Data Augmentation**: Applying traditional augmentation techniques
3. **Deep Learning**: Implementing a CNN architecture optimized for binary classification
4. **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive comparison across different data balancing strategies

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Image Resizing**: All images resized to 148Ã—148 pixels
- **Normalization**: Pixel values normalized to [0,1] range
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converted to single-channel grayscale images

### 2. Data Balancing Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Traditional Data Augmentation

- Rotation (Â±35Â°)
- Width/Height shifts (0.1/0.08)
- Shear transformation (0.2)
- Zoom (0.2)

#### Strategy 2: GAN-based Data Generation

- **Architecture**: Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
- **Generator**: 4-layer transposed convolution network
- **Discriminator**: 4-layer convolution network
- **Training**: 40,000 iterations with RMSprop optimizer
- **Output**: 2,534 synthetic normal X-ray images

#### Strategy 3: Combined Approach

- Integration of augmented and GAN-generated images
- Comprehensive dataset balancing

### 3. Model Architecture

Our CNN architecture consists of:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Multiple Conv2D layers with ReLU activation
- **Pooling Layers**: MaxPooling2D for dimensionality reduction
- **Normalization**: BatchNormalization for training stability
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- **Output**: Single sigmoid neuron for binary classification

    BatchNormalization(),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),

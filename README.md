# Pediatric-Chest-Pneumonia-Classification-System

Machine learning and deep learning are the branch of artificial intelligence that has had 
exponential growth in recent years. By using these we can work with numbers, text, 
images and so many other things. At this time, we have a lot of contemporary successful 
examples that have been implemented such as: autonomous Vehicles, chat bots, even 
weâ€™re now generating new data from previous. Computer vision is one of the sub fields 
of deep learning which focuses on processing images. In the field of health care system, 
we have many systems which can assist doctor while diagnosing different type of 
diseases. In this project we worked on Pediatric Chest X-ray classification which can 
classify whether the X-ray image infected by pneumonia or not.
